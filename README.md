# TV Show Tracker
A simple locally hosted TV show tracking website which uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, SQL, NodeJS and RESTful APIs to function.

This was a project I did while learning the basics of Full Stack Development. I was a student in the Purdue IEEE Software Saturdays program. Over the course of a semester, I learnt the various technologies that are integrated together to build a website.

## To run this website:
1. Install NodeJS in the local directory (Or use the modules provided)
2. Type "localhost:8080/api/portal/" in your browser URL bar
